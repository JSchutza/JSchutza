# Flask React Project

This is the backend for the Flask React project.

## Getting started

1. Clone this repository (only this branch)

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/appacademy-starters/python-project-starter.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   pipenv install --dev -r dev-requirements.txt && pipenv install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create a **.env** file based on the example with proper settings for your
   development environment
4. Setup your PostgreSQL user, password and database and make sure it matches your **.env** file

5. Get into your pipenv, migrate your database, seed your database, and run your flask app

   ```bash
   pipenv shell
   ```

   ```bash
   flask db upgrade
   ```

   ```bash
   flask seed all
   ```

   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

6. To run the React App in development, checkout the [README](./react-app/README.md) inside the `react-app` directory.

_IMPORTANT!_
If you add any python dependencies to your pipfiles, you'll need to regenerate your requirements.txt before deployment.
You can do this by running:

```bash
pipenv lock -r > requirements.txt
```

_ALSO IMPORTANT!_
psycopg2-binary MUST remain a dev dependency because you can't install it on apline-linux.
There is a layer in the Dockerfile that will install psycopg2 (not binary) for us.

## Deploy to Heroku

- heroku login

- heroku container:login

Update the `REACT_APP_BASE_URL` variable in the Dockerfile.
This should be the full URL of your Heroku app: i.e. "https://flask-react-aa.herokuapp.com"

- heroku container:push web -a {NAME_OF_HEROKU_APP}

- heroku container:release web -a {NAME_OF_HEROKU_APP}

9. set up your database:

   ```bash
   heroku run -a {NAME_OF_HEROKU_APP} flask db upgrade
   heroku run -a {NAME_OF_HEROKU_APP} flask seed all
   ```
